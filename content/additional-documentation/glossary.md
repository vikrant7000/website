A mini audio connector used in the LED controller and possibly other builds.

#### 3.5mm right angle, bare wire male audio connector

A mini right angle audio connector used in the LED controller and possibly other builds.

#### 5 volt 2.5 amp micro USB power supply

A power supply that will provide ample power for a Raspberry Pi.

#### 1K Resistor

A 1000 ohm resistor that is used in the LED Controller and possibly other builds.

#### 10K Resistor

A 10,000 Ohm resistor that is used in the LED controller and possibly other builds.

#### 12 volt, 1 amp DC barrel jack power supply

A power supply component used with the DC Female panel barrel jack in termperature controller and possibly other builds.

#### 110v Electical Receptacle (Wall outlet)

A component used in the Power Controller and possibly other builds.

#### API

Application Programming Interface - A description document for that includes information about the operating system, database, definitions, configuration files, and protocols.

#### Breadboard

A multi-socketed component used to create and test circuitry used for reef-pi builds.

#### Build Guides

Reef-pi specific guides that describe the components needs and the steps used to create a power controller, ATO, LED Controller (named LED Lighting), Temperature Controller, Dosing Controller, All-in-one Controller, etc. The page is located at https://reef-pi.github.io/build-guides/.

#### Commit

Takes a snapshot of the project in a local repository after adding information, code, or other changes.  A push is required to save the commit to GitHub.

#### Cron

A software utility that is a time-based job scheduler for Reef-Pi. It is used to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

#### DC female panel mount barrel jack

A component used in the temperature controller and possibly other builds.

#### General Guides

Reef-pi specific guides used to install and configure reef-pi, touchscreen, How to Build A Housing, How To Ask For Help, Troubleshooting, overview of Electronic Components, etc.  The page is located at https://reef-pi.github.io/guides/.

#### Git

See Git Hub - Git is a distributed version control system. Git is known as a "distributed" (rather than "centralized") version control system because you can run it locally and disconnected from the Internet, and then "push" your changes to a remote system (such as GitHub) whenever you like.

#### GitHub

A version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

#### GitHub Repository

Both Git and GitHub refer to this as a repository, or repo for short, a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves.

#### Jumpers

Male to Female and/or Female to Female wires of varied lengths with pins or that can have pins soldered to them that are used to connect different components together on, to, or from a breadboard and/or the Pi.

#### L293D

A bridge motor driver transistor component used in the Dosing Controller build.

#### PCA9685 Breakout Board

This board is a component used in the LED controller and Dosing Controller and possibly other builds.

#### Peristaltic Pump

A component that pumps fluid and is used in the dosing controller build.

#### Photoelectric Water Level Sensor

A component that is used to sense the water level causing the ATO controller tell a pump to pump water. 

#### PN2222

A transistor that acts like a switch and is used in the LED controller build.

#### Power socket with fuse

A 10 amp 250 volt (US) component used in the power controller and other builds.

#### Pull or Pull Request

When you open a pull request, youÂ’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches.

#### Push

Saves a local repository commit to a GitHub project.

#### PWM

Pulse Width Modulation - A method of diming leds current by pulsing current.

#### Raspberry Pi

A single board computer that is used in the Reef-pi controller.  Depending on the requirements, a Pi zero or Pi B may be used instead of the Pi 3.

#### Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen

The 7" version of the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen.  Other sizes are also available.

#### reef-pi

The software part of the reef tank controller based on the Raspberry Pi with software developed by Ranjib.

#### Relays

Switches power to a another component on and off based on a signal from the Raspberry Pi and software logic.  Both mechanical and solid state may be used, but the relay used it may vary the type of build or your requirements.

#### Repo

See Github repository

#### Shell

Shell is a user program or it's environment provided for user interaction. Shell is an command language interpreter that executes commands read from a keyboard or from a file.

#### Script

Shells are normally interactive, but if you use command one by one, then you can store this sequence of command to text file and tell the shell to execute this text file instead of entering the commands. This is known as shell script.

#### Submersible Water Pump

A component used in the ATO Controller build.

#### ULN2803a

A DC motor driver component used in the ???? Return Pump???? Controller build.

#### Universal Power Cord: NEMA5

The power cord component that connects to the Power Socket with fuse and is used in the Power Controller build and possibly others.

#### USB to TTL Cable

A cable used to connnect the Raspberry Pi to a computer or monitor. There are different versions; ensure you get the right version for you computer or monitor.  Other software may be required.

#### YAML

YAML Ain't Markup Language - A a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files like the one in the early versions of Reef-Pi.
